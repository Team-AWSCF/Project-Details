Project Scenario:

Your team is a cloud consulting firm specializing in cloud infrastructure and automation. You are currently in early stage talks with a client company who has submitted a request for proposal (RFP) to migrate the companyâ€™s existing on-prem infrastructure to the cloud. As part of the desired change, your client would also like to transition to a DevOps methodology when it comes to the deployment and upkeep of its new cloud infrastructure. The board of directors would like to see, in a single presentation, how this can be accomplished with your help. Your presentation should present a compelling case to work with you for this project.
