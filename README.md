## Scenario

Your team is a cloud consulting firm specializing in cloud infrastructure and automation. You are currently in early stage talks with a client company who has submitted a request for proposal (RFP) to migrate the company’s existing on-prem infrastructure to the cloud. As part of the desired change, your client would also like to transition to a DevOps methodology when it comes to the deployment and upkeep of its new cloud infrastructure. The board of directors would like to see, in a single presentation, how this can be accomplished with your help. Your presentation should present a compelling case to work with you for this project.

## Proposal Deliverable

  - request for proposal (RFP) to migrate the company’s existing on-prem infrastructure to the cloud
  - DevOps methodology when it comes to the deployment and upkeep of its new cloud infrastructure (Infrastructure as Code / Automation)
  - Each student must create and submit one working script that automates cloud system deployment or an aspect of the migration to cloud
  - Cost analysis of both the process of migrating to cloud/DevOps style administration and monthly operational expenses (OpEx) associated with cloud usage
  - GNS3 create a working LAN that depicts the company’s remaining on-prem environment
  - Demonstrate how encrypted connectivity to the private cloud is performed from a local host
  - Include in your cloud environment the following components:
      - AD/Domain Controller(s)
      - Web Server(s)
      - File Server or cloud-based file sharing platform(s)
